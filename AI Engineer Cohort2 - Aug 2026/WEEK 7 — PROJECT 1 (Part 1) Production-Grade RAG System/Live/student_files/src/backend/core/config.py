# Student Guide: config.py
#
# Purpose:
# Learn why every setting the app needs — API keys, model names, paths — is
# read from one place instead of being scattered across rag/ and services/.
#
# What to focus on:
# - Why pydantic-settings instead of just os.environ.get() everywhere
# - Where these values actually come from at runtime (.env locally, real
#   environment variables in Docker/Azure — see the "Deployment architecture"
#   diagram in the main README)
# - Why every field defaults to an empty string instead of crashing at import
#
# TODO for students:
# 1. Trace one setting end to end: OPENAI_API_KEY here -> where it's read in
#    llm.py -> where it's actually set (your local .env, or a docker run -e
#    flag, or an Azure App Setting).
# 2. Explain why OPENAI_MODEL has no default value like APP_NAME does. What
#    breaks if it's left unset? (Hint: ask about llm.py's ChatOpenAI call.)
# 3. This class is imported as a single `settings` object at the bottom.
#    Why does the rest of the app import `settings`, not `Settings`?
