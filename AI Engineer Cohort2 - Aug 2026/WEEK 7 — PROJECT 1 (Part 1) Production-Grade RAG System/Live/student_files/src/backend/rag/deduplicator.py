# Student Guide: deduplicator.py
#
# Purpose:
# Learn how duplicate chunks are removed after retrieval.
#
# What to focus on:
# - Why repeated chunks are bad for the LLM
# - Why a simple dictionary can remove exact duplicates quickly
# - Why deduplication improves token usage and answer quality
#
# TODO for students:
# 1. Explain why page_content is used as the dictionary key.
# 2. Describe what kind of duplicates this removes.
# 3. Suggest one limitation of this approach.
