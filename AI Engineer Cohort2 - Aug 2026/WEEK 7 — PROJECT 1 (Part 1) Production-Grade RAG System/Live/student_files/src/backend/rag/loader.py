# Student Guide: loader.py
#
# Purpose:
# Learn how documents are loaded from PDF, DOCX, and TXT files.
#
# What to focus on:
# - Different file formats need different loaders
# - The loader returns a list of Document objects
# - Each Document keeps text plus metadata such as source and page number
# - load_document() accepts EITHER a directory OR a single file path — that
#   matters for ingestion_service.py's TODO #4 below.
#
# TODO for students:
# 1. Identify which loader is used for each file type.
# 2. Explain why metadata is important.
# 3. _load_single_file() checks `os.path.getsize(file_path) == 0` before
#    doing anything else. What would happen without that check if a student
#    uploaded a 0-byte file?
# 4. Add support for another file type as an exercise if you want.
