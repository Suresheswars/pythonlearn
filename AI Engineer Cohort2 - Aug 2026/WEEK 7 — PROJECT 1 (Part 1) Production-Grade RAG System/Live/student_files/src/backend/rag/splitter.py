# Student Guide: splitter.py
#
# Purpose:
# Learn how documents are broken into smaller chunks before indexing.
#
# What to focus on:
# - Why large documents must be split
# - Why overlap helps preserve meaning across boundaries
# - Why chunking affects retrieval quality
#
# TODO for students:
# 1. Explain why chunk_size=800 is a practical production choice.
# 2. Explain why chunk_overlap=50 helps with context continuity.
# 3. Try a smaller chunk size and observe the effect on retrieval.
