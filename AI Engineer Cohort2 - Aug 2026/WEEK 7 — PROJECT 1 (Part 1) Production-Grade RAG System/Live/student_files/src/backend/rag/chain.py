# Student Guide: chain.py
#
# Purpose:
# Learn how the prompt, LLM, and output parser are chained together.
#
# What to focus on:
# - Why the prompt includes both context and question
# - Why the chain stays small and reusable
# - Why output parsing is separated from generation
#
# TODO for students:
# 1. Explain the role of each pipe in the chain.
# 2. Change the prompt to be more strict and observe the impact.
# 3. Describe how this file supports answer generation.
