# Student Guide: main.py
#
# Purpose:
# This is where the whole backend gets wired together. Nothing here does
# RAG work — it configures the FastAPI app and plugs in the pieces built
# everywhere else.
#
# What to focus on:
# - The order of operations at the top: env vars are set BEFORE the api
#   package is imported. That's not accidental — see the comment inline.
# - The logging middleware wraps every request, not just /upload and
#   /retrieve. That's how the log lines you see in Azure's Log Stream get
#   their method/path/status_code/duration fields.
# - app.include_router(...) is the actual moment routes.py's endpoints
#   become reachable at all.
#
# TODO for students:
# 1. Why must the os.environ[...] lines run before
#    `from src.backend.api import routes, health`? What would go wrong if
#    you moved the import to the top of the file?
# 2. This file never mentions port 8000 or 8080. Where is the port actually
#    decided? (Hint: it's not in this file at all — check entrypoint.sh.)
# 3. allow_origins=["*"] in CORSMiddleware is permissive. Why is that an
#    acceptable choice for this project, and when would it not be?
